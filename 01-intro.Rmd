## Methods to upload the files

To begin with, you need to set up the working directory and upload the required files. Here we have three options to upload the files.

**Start with Ms file**: If your data is in raw format, you may first convert it to .mgf format using HPC_tidymass. Then click on ‘Start with Ms file’ to upload the file.
