We also need necessary MS2 databases for metabolite annotation, you may download these databases from [metid website](https://www.tidymass.org/metid/articles/public_databases.html){target="_blank"}. You can also use Tidymass to build your own database, but please be noted that the format should be in ".rda".

After the download is complete, place them in a new folder and click **CHOOSE FOLDER**.

Here we also provide some public databases and you can simply select them to perform annotation without downloading anything.
