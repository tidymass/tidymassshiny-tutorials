The app can only be installed via code now, and we will introduce how to do that step by step in this chapter. 1.1 Preparations To begin with, you need to install R and Rstudio, both of which can be free downloaded from official websites. If you have installed them before, please ensure that R version &gt; 4.1 as tidymass required, ohterwise download and install the latest version of R. Install R Download R and install it. Install Rstudio Download Rstudio and install it. Open the Rstudio Setting up the suitable Mirror You may set up the suitable mirror to accelerate R package downloads. Click “Tools” in the Rstudio, then click “Global options” and select “Packages”. You may select mirror from TUNA Team if you are users from China. 1.2 Methods to install tidymass shinyapp Here we provide three different methods to install tidymass shinyapp: R, Docker and Server. Install with R To install the app with R, you are recommended to run the following code. if (!require(&#39;remotes&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;remotes&#39;); if (!require(&#39;writexl&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;writexl&#39;); if (!require(&#39;tidyverse&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;tidyverse&#39;); if (!require(&#39;tidymass&#39;)) { source(&quot;https://www.tidymass.org/tidymass-packages/install_tidymass.txt&quot;); install_tidymass(from = &quot;tidymass.org&quot;) }; if (!require(&#39;shinyFiles&#39;)) remotes::install_github(&#39;thomasp85/shinyFiles&#39;); if (!require(&#39;shinyWidgets&#39;)) remotes::install_github(&quot;dreamRs/shinyWidgets&quot;); if (!require(&#39;shiny&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;shiny&#39;); if (!require(&#39;bsicons&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;bsicons&#39;); if (!require(&#39;bslib&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;bslib&#39;); if (!require(&#39;plotly&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;plotly&#39;); if (!require(&#39;colourpicker&#39;)) install.packages(&#39;colourpicker&#39;); if (!require(&#39;plantmdb&#39;)) remotes::install_github(&quot;xuebinzhang-lab/plantmdb&quot;) ## plant metabolomics database. for test use. if (!require(&#39;tidymassshiny&#39;)) remotes::install_github(&#39;tidymass/tidymass_shiny&#39;) To start the app, run the code. library(tidyverse) library(tidymass) library(tidymassshiny) library(plantmdb) ## for test use run_tidymass_shiny() You should be able to see: To update the app to the newest version, you can run the code. remotes::install_github(&#39;tidymass/tidymass_shiny&#39;) Install with Docker Install with Server "],["upstream-data-processing.html", "2 Upstream data processing 2.1 Data format converter 2.2 Methods to upload the files 2.3 Project initiate 2.4 Data import 2.5 Data quaily assessment 2.6 Data cleaning", " 2 Upstream data processing To perform multiple analysis with tidymass shinyapp, you need to upload files first, the demo data can be downloaded through Google Drive or BaiduNetdisk. 2.1 Data format converter If your data is in raw format, you may first convert it to .mzML or .mzXML format using ProteoWizard. Please note that ProteoWizard only support Windows OS, you may consider massconverter if you don’t use Windows OS. You can refer to the following parameter settings for ProteoWizard. 2.2 Methods to upload the files To begin with, you need to set up the working directory and upload the required files. Here we have three options to upload the files. Start with Ms file: If you have raw data in the format like .mzML or mzXML. You can click on ‘Start with Ms file’ to upload the file. Start with table file: If your data is a post-peak metabolite expression matrix, you can click on the ‘Start with table file’ button to upload the data. The sample table is as follows, and the first four columns must exist, with column names not to be changed. Start with massdataset object: If your data is generated by tidymass, you can choose the ‘Start with massdataset object’ button and directly upload them. 2.3 Project initiate Here are the steps you need to follow to initiate the project: Set working directory Upload sample_info.csv file You may click the dropdown button and adjust the column names if there are any changes for them. Click “INITIALIZE PROJECT” button and check the sample information. 2.4 Data import Upload Ms file Before import the data, please ensure that the files are well anranged. Here is an example: Click the dropdown button Data import and select Start with MS file. Then click SELECT MS1 FOLDER and choose the MS1 folder. Next, click CHECK INPUT FILE and you will see the number of files you have just uploaded. If the files are ready for analysis, you can begin to optimize peak picking parameters. The first step is to choose the ppmCut. And the second step is to run with the ppmCut. (need to scroll down to find the button) Finally, click START PEAK PICKING and get the results. Upload table file Click the dropdown button Data import and select Start with table file. Then click BROWSE and select the csv table. Next, click INPUT FILE SUMMARY and you will see a summary of input file. If all the check have passed, then click GENERATE MASSDATASET OBJECT to obtain massdataset objects for both positive and negative modes. Upload table file If you already have massdataset objects generated by tidymass, you can simply upload them in this way. Seperately upload object for positive and negative mode and click CKECK INPUT 2.5 Data quaily assessment To have an overall understanding and assessment about the data, you can select Overview and click START to generate plots. 2.6 Data cleaning Before metabolite annotation, it’s necessary to perform data cleaning. Remove noisy metabolic features The first step is removing noisy metabolic features. Here we choose to remove variables which have MVs in more than 20% QC samples and in at lest 50% samples in control group or case group, so the MV cutoff of QC samples (%) has been set as 20 and MV cutoff (%) has been set as 50. Click START and SHOW PLOT to see the results. Filter outlier samples First, click START above to show the plots. Then click START below to filter outlier samples Missing value imputation Click START to perform missing value imputation Data normalization and integration Click START to perform the normalization and integration. Then click SHOW PLOT to visualize the difference before and after the normalization.

Then click START. We also need necessary MS2 databases for metabolite annotation, you may download these databases from metid website. You can also use Tidymass to build your own database, but please be noted that the format should be in “.rda”. After the download is complete, place them in a new folder and click CHOOSE FOLDER. Here we also provide some public databases and you can simply select them to perform annotation without downloading anything. 3.2 Annotation filtering Click Adduct for level 3 annotation and then click START to perform annotation filtering. 3.3 Origin analysis (to be done) "],["start-one-project.html", "4 Start one project 4.1 R package", " 4 Start one project 4.1 R package 1234 xiaotao shen test 123 "]]
