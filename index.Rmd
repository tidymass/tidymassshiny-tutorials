# Installation

**tidymass shinyapp** (https://github.com/tidymass/tidymass_shiny) is a user-friendly web application for **tidymass** (https://www.tidymass.org/) that requires little or no programming experience.

The app can only be installed via code now, and we will introduce how to do that step by step in this chapter.

## Preparations

To begin with, you need to install R and Rstudio, both of which can be free downloaded from official websites.

If you have installed them before, please ensure that R version > 4.1 as tidymass required, ohterwise download and install the [latest version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).

**Install R**

Download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and install it.

**Install tidymass**

You are recommended to install [tidymass](https://www.tidymass.org/) according to the steps on the official website.


## Install tidymass shinyapp

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
